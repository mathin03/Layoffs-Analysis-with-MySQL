The analysis on the layoffs dataset provides several key insights into the trends and distribution of layoffs across various dimensions such as companies, industries, countries, and time periods. Here are the major findings:

While Exploring Data with SQL, I was working on the following things...

1.Checked all the details of table such column name, data types and constraints
2.Checked for duplicate values in  column
3.Removed unwanted columns from table
4.Created a Primary key
5.Identitfied and corrected the mis-spelled city names
6.Counted the no.of lay_offs by rolling count/moving count using windows functions
7.Checked min,max,avg data for layoffs, percentage_layoffs & country column.


Maximum Layoffs:

The dataset contains records of significant layoffs, with the maximum number of layoffs by a single company reaching [Max Value] and the highest percentage of workforce laid off being 100%.
Companies with 100% Layoffs:

Several companies have laid off their entire workforce, indicating severe organizational or economic challenges. These instances are particularly critical, showing the complete shutdown of operations.
Layoffs by Company:

A detailed breakdown reveals that certain companies have significantly higher total layoffs compared to others. This highlights which companies are most impacted.
Date Range of Layoffs:

The layoffs span a wide range of dates, indicating that the data covers multiple years and potentially different economic cycles.
Industry Impact:

Certain industries are more affected by layoffs, with some industries showing a significantly higher number of total layoffs. This can help identify sectors that are more vulnerable during economic downturns.
Geographical Distribution:

The analysis shows that layoffs are distributed across various countries, with some countries experiencing higher total layoffs, reflecting regional economic impacts.
Temporal Trends:

The data reveals trends over time, with specific years and months showing higher layoff numbers. This temporal analysis helps understand the timing of economic distress.
Company Stage Analysis:

Companies at different stages of development experience varying levels of layoffs, providing insights into which stages are more susceptible to workforce reductions.
Rolling Total of Layoffs:

The cumulative sum of layoffs over time gives a clearer picture of the overall impact and trends in workforce reductions.
Yearly and Monthly Layoffs:

Breaking down layoffs by year and month shows the specific periods with higher layoffs, helping to pinpoint critical times.
This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the layoff trends and can help in strategizing workforce management, economic planning, and support measures for affected industries and regions. The findings can also guide future studies on the causes and effects of mass layoffs.
